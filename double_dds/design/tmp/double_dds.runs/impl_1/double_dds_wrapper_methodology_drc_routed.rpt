2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer

False path or asynchronous clock group between synchronous clocks  
A False Path timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks adc_clk and dac_clk_out (see constraint position 9 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE).
