DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP twoInMult_dds_ampl/U0/data_s_reg output twoInMult_dds_ampl/U0/data_s_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP twoInMult_dds_range/U0/data_s_reg output twoInMult_dds_range/U0/data_s_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.

REQP-1615#1 Warning
use_IOB_register  
The FDCE cell ltc2145_0/U0/ltc2145_capture_inst/data_a_s_reg[13] has IOB set to TRUE, but does not connect directly to an IO cell. Remove the constraint or ensure the FDCE is property connected to an IO.
Related violations: <none>
